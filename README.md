# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:
This project focuses on analyzing the ride-sharing data by city type. We will be using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summarized DataFrame. Furthermore, we will include a multiple-line graph using Pandas and Matplotlib to present the total weekly fares for each city type. As an result, the project will address the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average fare per drive by city type; and a multiple-line graph showing the sum of the fares for each week from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29.

## Results:
After we run the code, we conclude that Urban area has the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares among the city type.
<brb> Please see Figure 1 for details:

As shown in Figure 1, the lowest result for total rides, total drivers, and total fares is Rural area. Yet, it has the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. This means it is more expensive per ride in the Rural area because the fares are high with less amount of drivers and rides.

<brb> The second part of this analysis is mainly focusing on the sum of weekly fares from 2019-01-01 to 2019-04-29. As we can see from Figure 2, Urban area has outperformed the city type each week. Also, Rural area has remained the least amount of fares, and Suburban has booked the second place for both analysis.

<brb> Finally, we put the result of the second analysis into a multiple-line graph. From the graph we can say that the total weekly fare of Urban area has outperformed the total weekly fare of Suburban and Rural area. Also, all three city types have had an increase of total fares at week 2019-02-24. Please see Figure 3 for more details.
